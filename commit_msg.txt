Fix: preserve paragraph choices when switching to untranslated language

When the dashboard switches to a language that lacks a translation for the selected paragraph, the option list (choices) was previously cleared. This caused shared option metadata to disappear.

Changes
-------
1. In `dashboard.rs` language selector and paragraph select handlers, if no translation is found:
   • Build a placeholder `ContextText` with the same number of choices.
   • Call `process_paragraph_select` to regenerate full choice tuples.
   • Sync the reducer so the UI reflects the existing choices with empty captions.
2. Updated logic compiles cleanly (`cargo check`).

This ensures option metadata remains intact across language switches, improving editor usability.
