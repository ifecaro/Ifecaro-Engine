Fix auto-restore effect and avoid paragraph concatenation

Key changes:
- Introduce `auto_restored` signal to ensure restore runs once and stops after first click.
- Guard restore effect with `auto_restored` and `initialized`.
- Disable restore effect on first on_choice_click to prevent first paragraph reappearing.
- Merge logic: game mode shows only last paragraph on new page but full path after refresh.

Resolves:
- No progress restored on reload.
- Paragraph 1+2 concatenation after first choice.
- Keeps full path after reload while keeping single paragraph on navigation.
