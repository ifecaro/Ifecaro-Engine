feat(ui): add single-select mode to ParagraphList dropdown

- Introduce `show_selected_chip` prop to `ParagraphList` (default true).
  * When false: selected item is shown in button; chip list hidden
  * Adds "None" placeholder to allow clearing selection

- Update usages:
  * Dashboard: paragraph selector now single-select
  * TranslationForm: paragraph selector now single-select
  * ChoiceOptions: target paragraph selector now single-select

- Verified with `docker compose exec app cargo check` (no errors)
